I will be creating a basic webpage that will allow me to click on a few links to recipes.

The skills that will have been demonstrated once completed are:
    - Able to naviagte for file through the command line
    - Able to memorize the boilerplate for basic html website
    - Getting comfortable with tags, and elements to create a webiste

Updates: Added a bit of CSS to the webpage
