        <!-- Describes what the dish is and where it came from-->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                This is a dish that originated in Senegal/Mali. It consists of mainly rice, chicken, and onions.
                The name "Yassa-Poulet" essentially means chicken that is cooked in an onion lemon sauce. 
            </p>
            <p> It is has a great aroma to it, and the chicken is not only so tender that it falls off the bone,
                but the onions itself gives it so much flavor, and I promise you it is to die for.

        <!-- Steps on how to make the dish -->
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a large bowl and put all of the chicken inside. Get a seperate small bowl for the marinade.
                Put dijon mustard, a splash of white vinegar, chicken pollo seasoning, salt, and pepper and mix until combnied.
            Marinate for at least 3 hours. </li>

            <li>While chicken is marinating, cut about 6 large onions into a bowl and make the same marinade used for chicken
                but omit the white vinegar. Add the lemon juice instead. Pour the marinade over the onions until coated
            and leave in fridge until chicken is done marinating.  </li>

            <li>Once three hours are up remove the chicken and onions, and pre-heat oven to 350 and once reached, put chicken in for about 35 minutes or until crispy. </li>

            <li>Once chicken is ready, remove from the oven and grab a large pot. Pour oil and let it get hot.
                Once oil is ready, add the chicken to brown skin. Then add the marinated onions.
                The water from the onions will come out which is where the sauce comes from.
            </li>

            <li>Once the sauce starts to bubble back, reduce heat and let simmer for 35 minutes.</li>

            <li>While the sauce is cooking, get some white rice, and cook to package instructions. It should finish
                around the same time as the sauce so save it for last.
            </li>

            <li>After the sauce is ready, remove from heat and leave lid on for 5 minutes</li>

            <li>The rice should be done, and it is ready to eat. Serve Hot</li>
        </ol>
