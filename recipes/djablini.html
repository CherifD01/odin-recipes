    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        This beverage is a Malian Ginger drink, which you guessed it, originated in Mali.
        It is a drink that is refreshing, and is good for getting rid of a stomach full of fried foods.

        It could be a little spicy, or burn a little bit, but add just a bit of water to dilute it, and you'll be fine.
